# This is an organizer app made with js

### To execute this app you need to install nodejs

First you need to have the .txt file in the same folder of the app
then you open the terminal and type node main.js ./"students file name" ./"topic file name" "number of groups"

In the txt files each line is like a record of a database, in each line you type one student per line and one topic per line.
